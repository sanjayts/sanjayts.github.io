      <description>fd is a blazing fast (I know, I know ðŸ˜‰) replacement for the in-built find command. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun incorporating it as part of my workflow so figured out I should at least blog about its basics.&#xA;The official readme details out all the possible flags/options for using the tool but I&amp;rsquo;ve reiterated them here for my personal quick reference, to internalise the syntax and with the hope that someone else might find it useful.</description>

      <description>I personally believe that using a terminal multiplexer is a must for anyone who spends a non-trivial amount working on remote *nix servers. This post is a gentle introduction to GNU screen but I would like to take a short detour and explain why they are useful.&#xA;Why use a terminal multiplexer? Some of the most obvious advantages being:&#xA;Ability to have a saved session for your work Cutting down the number of terminal windows you have to open Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss a usecase wherein you are logged on to your Edge/Gateway node and would like to monitor your Spark jobs, your HBase service and at the same time query Impala tables.</description>

      <description>A request was made in this Daniweb thread to split a string based on punctuations and whitespaces but with a twist. The splitting should make exceptions/allowances for special cases.&#xA;For e.g. let&amp;rsquo;s say we are splitting on . (the dot character). Our splitting should keep titles like Mrs. and Mr. intact. What does this mean? Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at it with an example (for those wondering, the code snippets are in Python programming language):</description>
